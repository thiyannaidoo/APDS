Customer Portal and API
Overview
This project is a customer portal developed using React/Angular that includes an API, enforcing security best practices such as password security, input whitelisting, SSL enforcement, and protection against common web attacks. A DevSecOps pipeline is also implemented to ensure continuous integration and security checks.

Features
1. Password Security
Passwords are hashed and salted using industry-standard algorithms such as bcrypt to ensure they are stored securely.
Hashing prevents plain-text password storage, and salting adds an extra layer of security to prevent rainbow table attacks.
2. Input Whitelisting
Input fields are validated using RegEx patterns to restrict any characters or sequences that could be used for injection attacks (e.g., SQL Injection, Cross-site Scripting).
Only whitelisted input will be accepted to ensure no dangerous characters are processed by the application.
3. Securing Data in Transit with SSL
All traffic between the client and the server is served over HTTPS, secured using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).
A valid SSL certificate and key are generated to encrypt communication, preventing attackers from intercepting sensitive data.
4. Protecting Against Attacks
The system is configured to protect against several common web attacks:
Helmet is used to secure HTTP headers.
Express Brute (or an equivalent) is implemented to limit the rate of login attempts, reducing the risk of brute force attacks.
Protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and SQL Injection is enforced.
5. DevSecOps Pipeline
A DevSecOps pipeline is configured to automatically trigger security checks, tests, and deployments whenever new code is pushed to the repository.
The pipeline includes linting, unit testing, and static security analysis to ensure a secure and stable codebase.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed on your system:

Node.js and npm. You can download Node.js from here.
Git for version control. Install it from here.
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/customer-portal-api.git
cd customer-portal-api
2. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Generate SSL Certificates (Local Development)
For development, you can generate self-signed SSL certificates:

bash
Copy code
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server.key -out server.crt
4. Create a .env File
Create a .env file in the project root and add your configuration:

makefile
Copy code
PORT=443
SSL_KEY=path/to/your/server.key
SSL_CERT=path/to/your/server.crt
5. Run the Application
bash
Copy code
npm start
The app will be available at https://localhost:443.

Security Features
bcrypt for hashing and salting passwords.
Helmet for HTTP header protection.
RegEx patterns to ensure only whitelisted characters are accepted.
SSL for encrypting traffic.
Rate limiting for login attempts (prevents brute-force attacks).
Running Tests
Unit Tests: Run unit tests for the application using:

bash
Copy code
npm run test
Security Checks: Ensure that ESLint and security vulnerabilities are checked:

bash
Copy code
npm run lint
npm audit
Deployment
Ensure that the environment variables for the production environment are set up correctly (e.g., for SSL certificates and database credentials).
Run the following command to build and deploy:
bash
Copy code
npm run build
Future Enhancements
Integrating OAuth 2.0 for secure third-party authentication.
Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.
Adding encryption at rest for sensitive user data stored in the database.
